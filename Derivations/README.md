# About the Derivations
These derivations are Jupyter Notebooks. To view them properly, you'll need to have either Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab installed. This is a free libray for scientific computing available here: https://jupyter.org/. All outputs have been cleared in these derivations to minimize the amount of space the math formatting takes up in the PyNite repository. Once you open a derivation in Jupyter you'll need to run all cells to view the output.
