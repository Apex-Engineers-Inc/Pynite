Creating PDF Reports
====================

Requirements
============

In order to use Pynite's reporting features you'll need to install ``Jinja2``. If you want reports in ``pdf`` format you'll also need to install ``PDFKit``:

* Jinja2 - ``Jinja2`` is a templating engine used for creating HTML files using Python.
* PDFKit - ``PDFKit`` converts HTML files to PDF files via ``wkhtmltopdf`` (see discussion on ``wkhtmltopdf`` below).

For ``pdf`` output, you'll also need to install ``wkhtmltopdf``, which is a program, rather than a Python library. Installers for various operating systems can be freely downloaded here: `download wkhtmltopdf <https://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html>`_.

Configuring ``wkhtmltopdf`` on Windows
======================================

Once ``wkhtmltopdf`` is installed, ``Pynite`` needs to be able to find it. ``Pynite`` will search some commonly used directories to find it, but if it's having trouble finding it you'll need to set your environment PATH variable to include the path to ``wkhtmltopdf.exe``. This step ensures ``Pynite`` can find and use ``wkhtmltopdf``. On Windows this can generally be done by going to ``Control Panel -> System & Security -> System -> Advanced System Settings -> Environment Variables``. On Windows 11 you can also just type "env" in the search bar to bring it up. From there you can edit the "Path" variable to include the file path to the folder containing ``wkhtmltopdf.exe``. The path you need to add will most likely be "C:\\Program Files\\wkhtmltopdf\\bin" or something similar, depending on where you installed it.

Configuring ``wkhtmltopdf`` on Other Operating Systems
======================================================

I've only ever done this for Windows, so for other operating systems I recommend going to the PDFKit documentation on PyPI here: `PDFKit on PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/pdfkit/>`_. It explains PKFKit configuration options that "should" work, thought I've never done it myself. Good luck!

Generating & Customizing Reports
================================

Generate reports by importing the ``Reporting`` module and then calling the ``create_report`` method. By default, the report prints everything, but it can be customized by setting the various keyword arguments in the ``create_report`` method to ``False``. Also by default, the report is saved in the ``Pynite`` folder unless another filepath is specified using the ``output_filepath`` argument. Reports can be generated as ``pdf`` or ``html`` using the ``format`` keyword argument in the ``create_report`` method.

Syntax:

.. code-block:: python

    create_report(model, output_filepath='.//Pynite Report.pdf', format='pdf', nodes=True,
                  members=True, plates=True, member_releases=True,
                  node_reactions=True, node_displacements=True,
                  member_end_forces=True, member_internal_forces=True,
                  plate_corner_forces=True, plate_center_forces=True,
                  plate_corner_membrane=True, plate_center_membrane=True)

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    # Import the reporting module
    from Pynite import Reporting
    
    # Create the report
    Reporting.create_report(my_model, output_filepath='./My Report.pdf', format='pdf')
