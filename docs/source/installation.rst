Installation
============

Pynite can be installed via ``pip`` (Python's default package installer). Run the following command
from the command line:

.. code_block:: console

    pip install PyNiteFEA

Be sure to install ``PyNiteFEA`` rather than ``PyNite``. The second one is a different package that
has nothing to do with finite element analysis.

For engineers who may be new to Python, if you placed Python on your system ``PATH`` during installation
you can run ``pip`` from any directory. Otherwise it's sitting in the ``Scripts`` folder in the
directory where Python was installed, and you'll need to either add it to your system ``PATH`` or
navigate to that directory via the console and run the ``pip`` command above.
