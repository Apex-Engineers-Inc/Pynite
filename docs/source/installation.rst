============
Installation
============

Pynite can be installed via ``pip`` (Python's default package installer). Run the following command
from the command line*:

.. code_block:: console
    
    $ pip install PyNiteFEA

*For engineers who may be new to Python, note that the ``$`` sign is just a placeholder for your
file path where pip is accessible. If you placed Python on your system PATH during installation
you can run pip from any directory. Otherwise it's sitting in the ``scripts`` folder in the
directory where Python was installed, and you'll need to either add it to your system PATH or
navigate to that directory via the console and run ``pip``.

Be sure to install ``PyNiteFEA`` rather than ``PyNite``. The second one is a different package that
has nothing to do with finite element analysis.
