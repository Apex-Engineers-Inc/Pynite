Installation
============

Pynite can be installed via ``pip`` (Python's default package installer). Run the following command
from the command line:

.. code_block:: 
    $pip install PyNiteFEA

Be sure to install ``PyNiteFEA`` rather than ``PyNite``. The second one is a different package that
has nothing to do with finite element analysis.
